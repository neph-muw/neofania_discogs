Neofonie Mobile Coding Challenge iOS Developer As part of the "getting to know each other" process, we'd like you to work on a small project which is hopefully a bit of fun. This is a chance for you to show off your coding skills. Think of the project as something that would be continued with a bigger team. Project Description: Build an iOS application for music lovers. Requirements: • As a user I want to search for an album by its title. • As a user I want to see the search result in a table view. • As a user I want to see a detailed screen for the selected album. • As a user I want to see an artist page for the album’s artist. Constraints: • It should not take more then 3-4 days. • The source code should be available for us easily (e.g. via Bitbucket, DropBox, email, etc... ) • The application must be easy to compile and deploy on a physical device. • You should use the free discogs.com API to get the data (https://www.discogs.com/developers/) • Please avoid 3rd party libraries. • The application should be written in swift. Bonus: • Unit tests • Layout for landscape orientation and tablets • I18N and L10N • Any other idea you come up with
